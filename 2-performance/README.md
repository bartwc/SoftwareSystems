This is assignment 2, about performance. You can find a description of this assignment
on [the website](https://software-fundamentals.pages.ewi.tudelft.nl/software-systems/website/part-1/assignments/performance.html)

In this folder you can find the source code for a raytracer written in Rust. This source code
