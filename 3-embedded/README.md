# Software Systems - Assignment 3: Embedded Systems

In this assignment you are going to build a small program running inside an emulator which emulates a Stellaris LM3S6965 microcontroller with an ARM M3 core.
You will be building a kind of GPS step counter that records changes in position, counts steps and displays some information in a graphical interface.
You will design a protocol to communicate with your system and implement a UART driver which provides a channel to communicate over.
