## How to Import the *itemis CREATE* Projects

1. When starting *itemis CREATE*, select this repository as the workspace directory.
2. Once YAKINDU has launched, Click on `File > Import`.
3. Select `General > Existing Projects Into Workspace` and click `Next`.
4. Choose `Select root directory`.
5. Browse to this directory (the one which has subdirectories `one_plane/` and `two_plane/`).
6. Make sure both projects are selected (checkboxes are checked).
7. Click on `Finish`.
8. You should now be able to open the `Statechart.ysc` files.
   - If you get a pop-up about whether to Copy or Link the files, choose to link.

### Hints
- Make sure your diagram gives an insightful overview of the system.
- Start by modelling the situation in which, at most, one pedal is pressed at the same time before modelling combinations
of pedal presses.
- The assignment leaves some degrees of freedom in the logic to be modelled. If your model tends to get very complicated,
then please revisit the modelling decisions that you have made.

## FSM Model - 1-Plane System
### *Description*
1. FSM model for a 1-plane system.
   * In this model, the values of the events can be ignored.

### *Requirements*
For each itemis model, hand in the following items:
1. itemis CREATE project (as it is in the repository)
2. Screenshot of graphical statechart
3. Textual modelling decisions (see the important remark in the Introduction)

Upload your models to the 5-fsm directory. Both models have their own subdirectory. Instructions for how to import
the itemis CREATE projects can be found in the README.md file in the repository.

### Introduction
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
Figure 1 shows the FSM Model for a 1-Plane Interventional X-Ray System that provides real-time visual images based 
on X-Rays. As per assignment's description, Figure 1 aims to provide an insightful overview of the states that exist
within the 1-Plane System. 

There are two states, "LowDose" and "HighDose", which relate to the low dose of X-Ray pedal, and a high dose of X-Ray
pedal respectively. When the Low-Dose X-Ray pedal is pressed, The ActionLogic block will initiate a request.startLowVideo
and the controller.activateLowVideo will be raised to the value of request.startLowVideo. The ActionLogic block will
initiate a request.startHighVideo when the High-Dose X-Ray pedal is pressed.

The "LowDose" state can also progress to the "HighDose" state to address the requirement, "While using low-dose streaming
video; surgeons need to be able to temporarily switch to high-dose streaming video, without releasing the low-dose
streaming video pedal."

### Modelling Decisions

1. As per the hints given, the team set the goal for the FSM - 1-Plane System to be insightful and not complicated.
   Hence, the team ensured that the number of states is minimal, yet sufficient. This also took into account the
   requirement that the "LowDose" state can still progress to the "HighDose" state. Transitions from one state to another
   are also carefully designed to ensure transition between states is smooth with no deadlock in a certain state. The
   state machine loop is also designed to be complete for the path to start and return to the start state(ActionLogic).
2. Since it was mentioned in the assignment description that values of the events can be ignored, "HighDose" state can
   only transit to "LowDose" state before returning to start state(ActionLogic). This is because without the usage of 
   values, the transition event "request.stopHighVideo" cannot repeat in the region. Initially, there was a transition
   from "HighDose" to "ActionLogic" which could not be triggered when the transition event "request.stopHighVideo" was
   the same. Furthermore, transition priority was also explored and deemed not suitable as "HighDose" leading back to
   "LowDose" or "ActionLogic" did not have prioritisation. Hence, the transition from "HighDose" to "ActionLogic" was
   removed as transiting from "HighDose" to "LowDose" was a necessary feature, which is similar to Pedal Scenario 2 in
   the UML assignment and the FSM Model for 2-Plane System.

## FSM Model - 2-Plane System
### *Description*
2. FSM model for a 2-plane system.
   * In this model, the value of the events needs to be considered.
   * Use the interface that was given above. You do not need explicit toggle selection requests.

### Introduction
Figure 2 shows the FSM Model for a 2-Plane Interventional X-Ray System that provides real-time visual images based
on X-Rays. As per assignment's description, Figure 2 aims to provide an insightful overview of the states that exist
within the 2-Plane System.

As compared to the 1-Plane System, there are three pedals for Low-Dose X-Ray streaming video. Each pedal represents each
projection, which are "Frontal", "Lateral", and "Biplane" respectively. For readability purposes, "Frontal", "Lateral",
and "Biplane" are labelled with "p1", "p2", and "p3" respectively in the interface request list.

As compared to the 1-Plane System, there are five pedals, 3 "LowDose" and 2 "HighDose", which relate to the 3 Low-Dose 
X-Ray pedals - p1, p2, p3, and 2 High-Dose X-Ray pedals - one for high dose projection and the other for high dose 
streaming video respectively. When the Low-Dose X-Ray pedal is pressed, The ActionLogic block will initiate a 
request.startLowVideo and the controller.activateLowVideo will be raised to the value of request.startLowVideo. The 
ActionLogic block will initiate a request.startHighVideo when the High-Dose X-Ray pedal is pressed.

The "LowDose" state can also progress to the "HighDose" state to address the requirement, "While using low-dose streaming
video; surgeons need to be able to temporarily switch to high-dose streaming video, without releasing the low-dose
streaming video pedal."

### Modelling Decisions

1. As per the hints given, the team set the goal for the FSM - 2-Plane System to be insightful and not complicated.
   Hence, the team ensured that the number of states is minimal, yet sufficient. This also took into account the
   requirement that the "LowDose" state can still progress to the "HighDose" state. Transitions from one state to another
   are also carefully designed to ensure that transition between states is smooth with no deadlock in a certain state i.e.
   able to return to start state (ActionLogic). This was tested more extensively as there exists more states as compared
   to FSM - 1-Plane System
2. Given the requirement that the value of the events needs to be considered in FSM - 2-Plane System, the
   "chosen_low_dose_pedal" variable was created to indicate whether pedal 1 (p1), pedal 2 (p2), or pedal 3 (p3) was 
   chosen. Once again, p1, p2, p3 relates to the respective planes "Frontal", "Lateral", and "Biplane". This enables a 
   feature where each of the Low-Dose states can transit to the "HighDose" state. When "stopHighVideo" request is sent, 
   it can transit back to the correct "Low-Dose" state based on the "chosen_low_dose_pedal" integer value that was last
   recorded. 
3. Another critical detail in the design is that transition priority from "HighDose" to any of the Low-Dose states need
   to be 1, 2, or 3. This is so that any of these three priorities are more important than the 4th priority transition where
   "HighDose" can return to "ActionLogic". If this is not adhered to, itemis software will have the simulation run and 
   cause "HighDose" to return to "ActionLogic" despite "chosen_low_dose_pedal" integer not being 0.
4. In the system description for the 2-Plane System, the pedal for High-Dose projection is meant to select the next 
   projection in a round-robin fashion. Hence, the sub-region shows the three projections being toggled in a round-robin 
   fashion.

## Question for Application Domain Expert
1. For FSM 1-Plane, is there a need for "HighDose" state to return to start state(ActionLogic)?
   If yes: the solution is to not ignore the value of events. Create a variable low_dose_pedal. If it equals 1, then 
   "HighDose" state transits to "LowDose" state. If it equals to 0, then "HighDose" state transits to "ActionLogic"
   state.
