# Software Systems Assignments
In this git repo you'll receive and make all the assignments for software systems.

For each assignment there will be a separate folder, e.g. for assignment 1 there is the folder `1-concurrency`.
If the assignment requires a report the pdf should go into the appropriate folder as well, for example, `1-concurrency/report.pdf`.

See [the website](https://cese.pages.ewi.tudelft.nl/software-systems/) for the assignment descriptions themselves.
