# UML

Your PlantUML diagrams should follow this naming scheme:

- Component diagram = `component.puml`
- Sequence diagrams
    - Configuration = `sequence-config.puml`
    - First pedal diagram = `sequence-pedal-1.puml`
    - Second pedal diagram = `sequence-pedal-2.puml`
- Class diagrams
    - Database = `class-database.puml`
    - High-level = `class-high-level.puml`

Name the exported images the same as the diagrams (expect for the file extension).

The report should cover your modeling decisions for each diagram. 
It either be a pdf or a markdown document.
Include your diagrams in the report.
